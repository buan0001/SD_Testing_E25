### Bank account
Suppose you have a bank account that offers variable interest rates:

- 0.5 per cent for the first 10000 kr credit
- 1 per cent for the next 10000 kr
- 1.5 per cent for the rest

If you wanted to check that the bank was handling your account correctly: 
1. What input partitions might you use?
2. What test case values could be inferred from said partitions?
