- For destinations outside of India, passengers are offered a discount of 25%, if the departure is not on a Monday or Friday
- Passengers who stay at least 6 days at their destination receive an additional discount of 10%
- Passengers older than 2 but younger than 18 years are offered a discount of 40% for all destinations
- Children 2 and under travel for free
