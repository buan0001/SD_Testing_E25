### Login
Draw a State Transition Diagram for an application login:

- A correct attempt logs the user in
- 3 failed attempts block the account

Alternative implementations:

- Showing an "account blocked" state
- Creating one transition for "1st pwd wrong" and another one for "2nd pwd wrong" (could be unmanageable if the number of attempts is big)
