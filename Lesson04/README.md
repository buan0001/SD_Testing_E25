## Class takeaways
Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:
- **Test Design Techniques: White Box**, with a special focus on:
  - The value of coverage as a testing metric
  - The difference between statement and decision coverage
  - How to calculate coverage with different unit testing frameworks (slides on **Pytest**, **Jest**, **PHPUnit**) 
- **Static Testing: Static Code Analysis**, specifically:
  - The value these tools bring to software quality
  - Linting, exemplified in JavaScript (check out the slides on **ESLint**)
  - Static code analysis tools like SonarQube
- **Test Design Techniques - Black-box**, with especial attention to:
  - State Transition Diagrams

## Homework
- Reflect on all of the above
- Finish the remaining [coverage calculation exercises](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Testing_E25/edit/main/Lesson04/01%20Coverage.md) (Number and Employees)
- Calculate coverage for your previous unit testing projects with your unit testing framework of choice
  - Evaluate whether the uncovered statements deserve a unit test or not
- Try linters for the programming language(s) of your choice with two purposes:
  - Finding syntax errors
  - Enforcing coding style and rules
- If you have not solved it already, do the [Airline](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Testing_E25/blob/main/Lesson02/09%20DT%20Airline.md) decision table testing exercise
- If into JavaScript, check out the [ESLint configuration file sample](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/eslint_sample)
- Try as many static code analysis tools as you can. SonarQube is a good starting point, but you may find others specifically designed for your programming language(s) of choice
  - [SonarQube Cloud free tier](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/the-new-sonarqube-free-tier-is-here)  
  - [SonarQube Community Build](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/sonarqube-community-edition) (local installation)
- Check out the following State Transition Diagram example:
  - [Checkout](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Testing_E25/blob/main/Lesson03/02%20ST%20Checkout.md)
- Solve the following State Transition Diagram exercises
