# Lesson 5 - 23 September

[-> Download DB testing slides!]: #

[-> Ask about their experience with SonarQube, linters and others]: #
[-> Ask whether they applied coverage to their existing projects]: #
[-> Coverage solution]: #
[-> IT]: #
[-> Airline solution]: #
[-> API Testing]: #
[  -> Demo devtools network tab with a PHP app (films?)]: #
[  -> Demo Postman's library v3]: #
[  -> Demo Postman's KEAs mock server]: #
[-> ATM solution]: #
[-> DB testing]: #
[-> Login solution]: #
[-> Continuous testing]: #
[  -> Demo py_cartridges_unit_tests, js_vat and php_words. If necessary, start afresh in py_eshop_unit_tests]: #

[## Class takeaways]: #
[Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:]: #
[- **Integration Testing**, with especial attention to]: #
[  - Advantages: protection against regressions, resistance to refactoring]: #
[  - Disadvantages: slow, difficult to maintain]: #
[- **API Testing**. Focus on:]: #
[  - How do API calls usually fail?]: #
[  - What to test for?]: #
[  - Postman (although you can use Insomnia, ThunderClient or any other similar platform)]: #
[- **Database Testing**]: #
[- **Continuous Testing**. Notice:]: #
[  - The difference between CI, CT, CD and the other CD]: #

[## Homework]: #
[- Integration testing]: #
[  - Solve the measure converter exercise(https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Testing_E25/blob/main/Lesson05/01%20Measure%20converter.md), where you will:]: #
[    - Apply your black-box and white-box test design knowledge]: #
[    - Decide what to mock and what not to mock (and, most importantly, why)]: #
[- API testing]: #
[  - Check out the library API v3(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_library_api_v3) Postman tests]: #
[    - Collection(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_library_api_v3/blob/main/postman/Library%20API%20v3.postman_collection.json)]: #
[    - Environment(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_library_api_v3/blob/main/postman/Library%20API%20v3.postman_environment.json)]: #
[  - Practice API testing in existing APIs of yours:]: #
[    - Create collections to group requests to the same API and environments to define variables]: #
[    - Write tests under "Scripts". You can use snippets and the built-in AI tool]: #
[    - Remember to write positive and negative tests]: #
[    - Sort your tests so that you can run them in a row]: #
[  - Solve the customers API exercise(https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Testing_E25/blob/main/Lesson05/02%20Customers%20API.md)]: #
[- Continuous Testing]: #
[  - Try one or several CI/CD applications on applications of yours]: #
[    - Create continuous integration jobs and pipelines]: #
[    - Run tests in the pipeline (unit tests, integration tests, linting, static code analysis tools)]: #
